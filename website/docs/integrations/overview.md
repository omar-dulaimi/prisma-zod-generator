# Integration Guides

We’re consolidating integration content so the links here reflect what actually exists in the repository. Until dedicated guides ship, start with the patterns below and adapt them to your stack.

## ✅ Available Resources

- **Next.js / React usage**: Combine the [Server Actions Pack](../features/server-actions.md) and [Forms UX Pack](../features/forms.md) to scaffold full-stack flows quickly.
- **Policy enforcement**: Pair [Policies & Redaction](../features/policies.md) with [PostgreSQL RLS](../features/postgres-rls.md) for multi-tenant backends.
- **SDK + Docs**: Use [Client SDK Publisher](../features/sdk.md) alongside the [API Docs Pack](../features/api-docs.md) to expose stable partner APIs.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Detailed framework- and platform-specific guides (Next.js App Router, tRPC, Vercel, Supabase, etc.) are in progress. Track progress or request a specific integration by opening an issue.
